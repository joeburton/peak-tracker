## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

```
DO NOT write any application code until Phase 0 deliverables are complete and explicitly approved.
DO NOT commit directly to `main` or `develop`.
DO NOT move to the next ticket without explicit review approval.
DO NOT access MongoDB or Dexie directly from components or route handlers.
DO NOT hardcode Wainwright-specific logic anywhere in the application.
DO NOT create placeholder or stub implementations.
DO NOT assume a single peak list. Design every feature generically.
DO NOT use middleware.ts — Next.js 16 uses proxy.ts instead.
DO NOT alter any MongoDB database other than `peakTracker` unless explicitly instructed by the user.
DO NOT create `__tests__` directories — all tests are colocated with their source files.
```

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Peak Tracker UK** is an offline-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) for tracking progress across UK hill and mountain lists.

The application is a **generic peak-tracking platform**. It must support any UK hill list without code changes.

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/joeburton/peak-tracker

### Initial Datasets

| List        | Count |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Wainwrights | 214   |
| Munros      | 282   |

### Future Datasets (architecture must support without code changes)

- Corbetts
- Grahams
- Nuttalls
- Hewitts
- Marilyns
- Donalds
- Any future UK hill list

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. Offline-first — the app must work without internet connectivity
2. Mobile-first — design and test on mobile viewports first
3. Accessibility-first — WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
4. Type-safe — TypeScript strict mode, zero `any`
5. Testable — repository pattern, dependency injection, no direct DB access in components
6. Extensible — generic platform, no hardcoded list logic
7. Production-ready — all quality gates must pass before a feature is considered done
8. Progressive Web App — installable, offline-capable, service worker
9. Feature-based architecture — colocate related code in feature folders
10. Server Components by default — use Client Components only where interactivity requires it

---

## TECHNOLOGY STACK

### Frontend

- **Next.js 16** (current stable: 16.2.x, App Router, Server Components by default)
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui**

### Authentication

- **Clerk** — social login (Google, Apple, GitHub), pre-built UI components
- Clerk must be configured using **`proxy.ts`** — not `middleware.ts` (removed in Next.js 16)
- Free tier: 10,000 monthly active users
- Clerk `userId` flows directly into the progress repository and MongoDB progress collection

### Server State

- **TanStack Query** — all remote data fetching and cache management

### Client State

- **Zustand** — ephemeral UI and application state

### Offline Storage

- **Dexie** (IndexedDB) — offline-first persistence

### Database

- **MongoDB** — database name `peakTracker` (both local and Atlas)
- Toggle between environments via `MONGODB_URI` only — no code changes required

### Validation

- **Zod** — all external data boundaries

### Testing

- **Vitest** — unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library** — component tests
- **Playwright** — end-to-end tests

### PWA

- **next-pwa**
- **Service Worker**

---

## TESTING CONVENTIONS

### Colocation rule (Non-Negotiable)

Test files must live next to the source file they test. Never use a top-level `__tests__` directory.

```
src/app/page.tsx                                    → src/app/page.test.tsx
src/lib/logger/index.ts                             → src/lib/logger/index.test.ts
src/features/peaks/services/statistics.ts           → src/features/peaks/services/statistics.test.ts
src/features/peaks/repositories/peak-repository.ts  → src/features/peaks/repositories/peak-repository.test.ts
```

- Unit and integration tests: `.test.tsx` / `.test.ts` colocated with their source file
- E2E tests only: `e2e/` directory at the project root (Playwright)
- The `src/__tests__/` directory is **excluded from vitest discovery** — never add files there

---

## NEXT.JS 16 — KEY CHANGES FROM 15

These are breaking or significant changes that affect implementation decisions.

| Change                  | Detail                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `middleware.ts` removed | Replaced by `proxy.ts` — all routing and auth middleware must use this          |
| Cache Components        | New explicit caching model using `use cache` directive and PPR                  |
| Turbopack               | Now the default bundler — no configuration required                             |
| `proxy.ts`              | New network boundary entry point — Clerk and any request interception goes here |

Before implementing the Auth milestone, review the Clerk documentation for Next.js 16 / `proxy.ts` compatibility and confirm the integration approach.

---

## YOUR ROLE

At the start of every project you are acting simultaneously as:

- **Solution Architect** — owns the technical vision and key decisions
- **Technical Lead** — ensures quality, consistency, and long-term maintainability
- **Senior Engineer** — writes production-quality code, tests, and documentation

Optimise for **long-term maintainability**, not short-term delivery speed.

---

## PHASE 0 — PLANNING (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE)

### Required Deliverables

You must produce all three documents before writing a single line of application code.

#### 1. `docs/architecture-review.md`

- Architectural overview
- Technology decisions and rationale
- Risks and mitigations
- Assumptions (including those listed below)
- Trade-offs
- Recommendations

#### 2. `docs/project-roadmap.md`

- Milestones (mapped to GitHub Milestones)
- Dependencies between milestones
- Delivery phases
- Estimated complexity per milestone

#### 3. `docs/github-tickets.md`

- Full ticket breakdown (see Ticket Format below)
- Updated with real GitHub issue URLs once issues are created

### Phase 0 also includes

- Create the **GitHub Project board** on https://github.com/joeburton/peak-tracker
- Create all **GitHub Milestones** before creating any issues
- Create all **GitHub Issues** and assign to milestones and project board

### Phase 0 Checklist

- [ ] Architecture review written and approved
- [ ] Roadmap written and approved
- [ ] Ticket breakdown written and approved
- [ ] Risks documented
- [ ] Assumptions documented
- [ ] GitHub Project board created
- [ ] GitHub Milestones created
- [ ] GitHub Issues created and added to project board
- [ ] Explicit approval received from the user

---

## KNOWN ASSUMPTIONS (document all in architecture-review.md)

1. **Auth is in scope via Clerk** — `userId` must be present on all progress records. Clerk is configured via `proxy.ts` in Next.js 16. Unauthenticated access to progress routes must be rejected.

2. **`dirty` flag is client-only** — `dirty` lives in Dexie only. It must never be stored in MongoDB. This is intentional — it is a sync concern, not a domain concern.

3. **Statistics are computed server-side** — derived data computed in a service layer on the server, not in repositories or client components.

4. **`peakListSlug` as foreign key** — peaks reference their list by slug. Known trade-off: renaming a list would require updating all associated peaks. Documented as a known limitation.

5. **Last Write Wins conflict resolution** — based on `updatedAt` and `version`. No event sourcing, CQRS, operation queues, or distributed locking.

6. **API routes undefined in initial spec** — must be designed and approved before Milestone 7 begins.

7. **Data sourced from DoBIH** — the Database of British and Irish Hills (DoBIH) is the canonical public source for Wainwright and Munro data. Claude Code must fetch, clean, validate against Zod schemas, and produce seed scripts. `verify-seed.ts` must exit non-zero if counts or validation fail.

8. **Clerk + Next.js 16 proxy.ts** — before implementing Milestone 2, verify Clerk's current documentation for Next.js 16 compatibility and confirm the correct `proxy.ts` integration pattern.

---

## GITHUB INTEGRATION

**Repository:** https://github.com/joeburton/peak-tracker

### Project Board

- Create the GitHub Project board during Phase 0
- All tickets must be created as **GitHub Issues**
- All issues must be added to the **GitHub Project board**
- Issue titles must include the category tag: e.g. `[Foundation] Setup Next.js project`
- Use GitHub auto-numbering as the canonical ticket reference: `#1`, `#2`, etc.
- Update `docs/github-tickets.md` with real issue URLs after creation
- Assign issues to the correct **GitHub Milestone**

### Branching Strategy

| Branch                                       | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `main`                                       | Stable, production-ready code only           |
| `develop`                                    | Integration branch — all features merge here |
| `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>` | One branch per ticket                        |

**Branch naming examples:**

```
feature/12-setup-nextjs-project
feature/23-mongodb-connection
feature/34-dexie-offline-store
```

**Rules:**

- Always branch from `develop`
- Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`
- Open a Pull Request to `develop` on ticket completion
- PR title must reference the issue: e.g. `Fix #12 — Setup Next.js project`
- Squash merge into `develop`
- PRs must pass type check, lint, and build before merge

---

## STATE MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE

### TanStack Query — Server State

All remote data fetching, caching, and sync must go through TanStack Query.

| Domain               | Responsibility                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Peak Lists           | Fetch, cache, and invalidate peak list data         |
| Peaks                | Fetch individual peaks and collections              |
| Statistics           | Fetch computed statistics from server service layer |
| Synchronisation APIs | Trigger and monitor client-server sync operations   |

**Rules:**

- No raw `fetch` calls in components — use TanStack Query hooks only
- Every query must define explicit `staleTime` and `gcTime`
- Mutations must invalidate relevant query keys on success
- All query keys must be centralised in `src/lib/queryKeys.ts`

---

### Zustand — Client State

Manages ephemeral UI and application state that does not need server persistence.

| Store              | Responsibility                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Search             | Current search term, debounced value                 |
| Filters            | Active filter selections (completion status, region) |
| Sort               | Active sort field and direction                      |
| UI Preferences     | Theme, view mode (list/map), sidebar state           |
| Connectivity State | Online/offline status, connection quality            |
| Sync State         | Sync in progress, last synced timestamp, error state |
| Progress State     | Locally tracked progress before sync confirmation    |

**Rules:**

- Each concern must be a **separate Zustand slice or store**
- All stores must be independently testable
- Use `persist` middleware only where explicitly specified
- Connectivity and sync state must stay consistent with Dexie and TanStack Query

**URL search params as source of truth for Search, Filters, and Sort:**

These three stores must be synced with URL search params. This is non-negotiable — it provides browser history, page-refresh persistence, and shareable links.

| URL param      | Store                | Field              |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| `?search=`     | Search               | `debouncedSearchTerm` (written after debounce) |
| `?completion=` | Filters              | `completionFilter` |
| `?region=`     | Filters              | `regionFilter`     |
| `?sort=`       | Sort                 | `sortField`        |
| `?dir=`        | Sort                 | `sortDirection`    |

**Two-layer contract for Search/Filters/Sort:**

1. **On page mount:** read `useSearchParams()` and call the relevant store setters to initialise from the URL.
2. **On user interaction:** update the store immediately (instant UI), then sync to the URL via `router.replace` (persistence and history).
3. **The URL is reset automatically on navigation** — no store reset hooks are needed or allowed for Search, Filters, or Sort.

**`useSearchParams` requires a `<Suspense>` boundary.** Wrap any Client Component that calls `useSearchParams()` in `<Suspense>` in its nearest Server Component ancestor.

---

### Dexie — Offline Persistence

Manages all client-side IndexedDB storage for offline-first capability.

| Table            | Responsibility                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Progress         | Peak completion records, timestamps, notes                   |
| User Preferences | Persisted settings (units, display preferences)              |
| Sync Metadata    | Last sync timestamp, pending changes queue, conflict records |

**Rules:**

- All Dexie access must go through a **repository pattern** — no direct table access in components or hooks
- Schema migrations must be versioned
- Sync metadata must track dirty records for upload on reconnection
- Repositories must be unit testable with mock adapters

---

### MongoDB — Persistent Storage

The authoritative server-side data store.

| Collection    | Responsibility                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Peak Lists    | Curated collections of peaks                 |
| Peaks         | Individual peak records                      |
| User Progress | Server-confirmed completion records per user |

**Rules:**

- All MongoDB access must go through a **repository pattern** — no raw queries in route handlers or business logic
- Define required indexes at collection setup — not lazily
- Provide seed scripts for all reference data

---

## REPOSITORY PATTERN (Non-Negotiable)

```text
src/lib/db/
├── mongodb.ts
├── repositories/
│   ├── peak-list-repository.ts
│   ├── peak-repository.ts
│   └── progress-repository.ts
```

UI components and route handlers must never import from `mongodb.ts` directly.
All data access goes through a repository interface.

---

## SYNCHRONISATION MODEL

### Strategy: Snapshot Sync

Do NOT implement:

- Event sourcing
- CQRS
- Operation queues
- Distributed locking

### Conflict Resolution: Last Write Wins

Based on `updatedAt` timestamp and `version` number.

### Sync Workflow

1. User action → update Dexie immediately
2. Update UI optimistically
3. Mark local record as `dirty: true`
4. When online: push dirty records to server
5. Pull latest server state
6. Resolve conflicts (last write wins)
7. Mark `dirty: false`, update `lastSyncedAt`

---

## DATA SEEDING

**Data source:** Database of British and Irish Hills (DoBIH) — the canonical public reference for UK hill data.

Claude Code must:

1. Fetch data from DoBIH
2. Clean and transform to match the Peak schema
3. Validate every record against the Zod schema
4. Write idempotent seed scripts
5. Run `verify-seed.ts` to confirm counts and data integrity

All seed scripts must be:

- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Validated against Zod schemas before insertion
- Verified with `verify-seed.ts`

### verify-seed.ts must confirm

- 214 Wainwrights present
- 282 Munros present
- All slugs unique
- All heights valid (metres and feet)
- All coordinates present and valid
- All required fields present
- Exits with non-zero status on any failure

### Peak List Page `/peak-lists/[slug]`

Contains:

- Statistics (total, completed, remaining, percentage, regional breakdown)
- Search (by name, debounced, case insensitive)
- Filters (completion status: All / Complete / Incomplete; region: dynamic from dataset — never hardcoded)
- Sorting (name, height metres, height feet, region, completion status — asc/desc)
- Peak list

### Auth Pages

- `/sign-in` — Clerk hosted sign-in component
- `/sign-up` — Clerk hosted sign-up component

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Per-Ticket Steps (in order)

1. Create feature branch from `develop`: `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
2. Implement the acceptance criteria
3. Write tests
4. Run `npm run typecheck`
5. Run `npm run lint`
6. Run `npm run build`
7. Open Pull Request to `develop` referencing the issue number
8. Write a clear summary of changes made

**Stop after step 8. Wait for explicit review approval before starting the next ticket.**

## DEFINITION OF READY

A ticket is ready when:

- [ ] Requirements understood
- [ ] All dependencies complete
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] GitHub Issue created and on the project board
- [ ] Assigned to correct GitHub Milestone
- [ ] Feature branch created from `develop`

## DEFINITION OF DONE

A ticket is done when:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` — zero errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` — zero errors
- [ ] `npm run build` — passing
- [ ] Documentation updated where relevant
- [ ] Pull Request opened to `develop`
- [ ] GitHub Issue linked in PR and closed on merge

## ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW TRIGGERS

Before implementing any major feature, pause and review:

- Existing architecture — does this change fit without breaking the pattern?
- Future extensibility — will this constrain the platform later?
- Performance implications — any bottlenecks for large datasets (282+ peaks)?
- Offline implications — does this work without a connection?
- Auth implications — does this correctly scope data to `userId`?
- Testing implications — is this independently testable?

Recommend and seek approval for changes before proceeding.

## QUICK REFERENCE

```
Phase 0 first. Always.
One ticket at a time. Wait for approval between tickets.
One branch per ticket. Branch from develop. PR to develop.
No direct MongoDB or Dexie access in components or route handlers.
No hardcoded list logic. Every feature is generic.
dirty flag lives in Dexie only — never in MongoDB.
Statistics are computed server-side in a service layer.
All query keys in src/lib/queryKeys.ts.
Separate Zustand store per concern.
userId (Clerk) on every progress record — in MongoDB and Dexie.
Clerk configured via proxy.ts — not middleware.ts (removed in Next.js 16).
Seed data sourced from DoBIH. Validated. Idempotent.
Toggle local/Atlas via MONGODB_URI only. No code changes.
All quality gates must pass before a milestone is closed.
Tests are colocated — src/app/page.tsx tests at src/app/page.test.tsx. Never use __tests__ directories.
```
